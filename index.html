  <p><strong>Project One: </strong>This is a code that I built in my programming class.
    Our assignment was to make a pizza array where we ask the user to select a small, medium, or large pizza. Then we asked them for the crust type of handtossed, deepdish, or thin. Next we asked them for how many toppings they wanted. After the info was entered, it would spit out their price.</p>

  <p><strong>Project Two: </strong> This was one of the more challenging codes that I have done.</p>
  <p>This code was to show different building options from the flooring to the type of building you wanted up to the square footage.</p>
  <p>First, you would enter the suqare footage. Next, you would enter the type of building you wanted such as Builders, custom, or luxury.</p>
  <p>Next, you would then choose the type of flooring that you would want in your new building such as carpet, tiling, or wood. Now depending on which option you chose would depend on how much you would end up paying. The base rate was 150 dollars.</p>
  <p>Depending on what every entry was worth, we would times that rate by the base cost and then come out with our total cost which would be displayed at the end.</p>
